Hey,

This is Xinjiang.  I'm a **full stack developer** for EXACT Sport in downtown Chicago and was an **independent freelancer**. Years of coding experiences both as a member in teams and a solo developer made me think more about **building products** in the eyes of final users rather than just building according to a pack of documentation from someone. I've been working in this industry for about 4 years now and still extremely **passionate** about all kinds of new stuff. Constantly pushing myself out of my **comfort zone** is the best quality I have as a human being. I'm a strong supporter of **Open Source** because it is doing better than damage. 

While I'm not coding, I like **reading** as often as possible, **writing** occasionally, **drawing** randomly, **cooking** creatively, **running** regularly.
