title: About Xinjiang 
---


Hey,

This is Xinjiang. I&#39;m a **full stack developer** for EXACT Sport in downtown Chicago and was an **independent freelancer**. Years of coding experiences both as a member in teams and a solo developer made me think more about **building** **products** in the eyes of final users rather than just building according to a pack of documentations from someone. I&#39;ve been working in this industry for about 4 years and still **passionate** about all kinds of new stuff. Constantly pushing myself out of my **comfort zone** is best quality I have as a human being. I&#39;m a stronge supporter for **Open Source** is doing more good than damage.&nbsp;

While I&#39;m not coding, I like **reading** as often as possible, **writing** occasionally, **drawing** randomly, **cooking** creatively, **running** regularly.

If you&#39;re looking for someone who can tell you how to **reverse a binary tree**, or doing what you told him without any of his input, I&#39;m sorry to tell you that I&#39;m not that guy. Like I told my Intern interviewer before, I want to build a real world product, a product which can **live like a person**. I&#39;m fully aware that there are  a lot of issues with a **growing** product. You have to fix your&#39;s or other&#39;s bugs. You have to add new features randomly appeared because of  a lunch break talk which ironically breaks other stuff you built. You need to communicate with your coworkers who have no clue about what they need but you have  to understand what they need. And  yoou probably will discuss with your coworkers about how the price should be formed, a new channel you heard which could increase your audience amount, how effective the new marketing strategy is.
