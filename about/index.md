title: About Xinjiang 
---


Hey,

This is Xinjiang.  I'm a **full stack developer** for EXACT Sport in downtown Chicago and was an **independent freelancer**. Years of coding experiences both as a member in teams and a solo developer made me think more about **building products** in the eyes of final users rather than just building according to a pack of documentation from someone. I've been working in this industry for about 4 years now and still extremely **passionate** about all kinds of new stuff. Constantly pushing myself out of my **comfort zone** is the best quality I have as a human being. I'm a strong supporter of **Open Source** because it is doing better than damage. 

While I'm not coding, I like **reading** as often as possible, **writing** occasionally, **drawing** randomly, **cooking** creatively, **running** regularly.

If you're looking for someone who can tell you how to **reverse a binary tree**, or doing what you told him without any of his input, I'm sorry to tell you that I'm not that guy. Like I told my Intern interviewer before, I want to build a real world product, a product which can be **a living organism**. I'm fully aware that there are a lot of issues with a **growing** product. You have to fix your's or other's bugs. You have to add new features randomly appeared because of a lunch break talk which ironically breaks other stuff you built before. You need to communicate with your coworkers who have no clues about what they need, but you have to figure out what they need. And you probably will discuss with your coworkers about how the price should be formed, a new channel you heard which could increase your audience, how effective the new marketing strategy is.
